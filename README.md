## Why you choose http port and not https
Better using nginx-proxy or other proxy and link it directly to the www container.

## Can I select different PHP versions
Yes, watch the tags in Docker Hub page

## Multi-Arch support
Yes, amd64, armv7 and arm64.

## About Wordpress
Wordpress is fully pre-patched for HTTPS

## About DotClear
Fully functionnal in vanilla version, last version installed

## About Drupal
Tested install full sucessfull with latest version, all install mode are supported.

## About SPIP
SPIP is fully patched to use InnoDB and not the official legacy engine. It's 100% fully functionnal.
You need to add SPIP_VERSION variable
```yaml
SPIP_VERSION="4.0.0" #Current version
```
## WARNING
Be carefull if you choose Drupal, change for another CMS or no CMS can danage the original container datas in case of misconfiguration.
